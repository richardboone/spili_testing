## Overview
SpiLiFormer (Spiking Transformer with Lateral Inhibition) is a novel brain-inspired spiking transformer architecture designed to enhance the performance and robustness of spiking neural networks (SNNs). 

Inspired by the lateral inhibition mechanism in the human visual system—which helps the brain focus on salient regions by suppressing responses from neighboring neurons—SpiLiFormer introduces two new attention modules:

- FF-LiDiff Attention (Feedforward-pathway Lateral Differential Inhibition): Inspired by short-range inhibition in the retina, this module reduces distraction in shallow network stages by differentially inhibiting attention responses.

- FB-LiDiff Attention (Feedback-pathway Lateral Differential Inhibition): Inspired by long-range cortical inhibition, this module incorporates feedback to refine attention allocation in deeper network stages.
